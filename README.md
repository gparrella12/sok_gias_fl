This repository hosts and maintains up-to-date systematization of Gradient Inversion Attacks and defenses in Federated Learning, following the categorization and threat model taxonomy introduced in our paper.

The tables are structured to provide a clear, comparative overview of the state-of-the-art, including:
- **Attack techniques** and their properties
- **Defense mechanisms** and their effectiveness
- **Threat models** with real-world applicability

Our goal is to offer a living resource for researchers and practitioners, reflecting the latest developments and evaluations in the field.
Tables will be updated regularly as new works and insights emerge.

Feel free to open issues or pull requests to suggest updates or corrections.
